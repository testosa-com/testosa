# XML Object
Reference: https://swagger.io/specification/#xml-object

A metadata object that allows for more fine-tuned XML model definitions.

When using arrays, XML element names are not inferred (for singular/plural forms) and the name property SHOULD be used to add that information. See examples for expected behavior.

:::caution Note
XML object validation is not yet supported

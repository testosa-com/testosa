# Discriminator Object
Reference: https://swagger.io/specification/#discriminator-object

When request bodies or response payloads may be one of a number of different schemas, a discriminator object can be used to aid in serialization, deserialization, and validation. The discriminator is a specific object in a schema which is used to inform the consumer of the specification of an alternative schema based on the value associated with it.

:::caution Note
Discriminator object validation is not yet supported
